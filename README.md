# auto-shake-fisch

auto-shake-fisch is a simple Python script for [Fisch](https://www.roblox.com/games/16732694052/Fisch). It uses image recognition and can be toggled on or off with the `F8` key.

## How to use

Before running the script, you need to install the following dependencies:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure that Python 3.6+ is installed on your machine.

2. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/toseina/auto-shake-fisch.git
   ```

3. **Install required libraries**: Run `setup.bat` to install required libraries. This will automatically install necessary Python libraries.

4. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python -u main.py
   ```

## Notes
- The image (like `shake.png`) needs to be placed in the same folder as `main.py`, or you can specify its path in the script.
- For the script to work, you'll need to shake your mouse. It's not my fault, blame Roblox.
- Press `F8` to start or stop the script.
